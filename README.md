# AutoCannon
![Alt text](https://github.com/Insolent-M1nx/AutoCannon/blob/master/autocannon.PNG?raw=true "AUTOCANNON")

AutoCannon is a simple script for bulk searches / submissions to URLscan.io.  This was created to aid in finding malicious Covid-19 domains.

This script works fine in Kali Linux. 

Required Dependencies:
----------------------

1: JQ Version - 1.6  
2: lolcat (not really required...but required. Nomsain?)

**Notes**
This script will generate a number of log files. This is for the upcoming UUID module (screen shots). AutoCannon is generating seperate log files so that I have UUID's for submitted and searched domains. This will be important for a number of additional modules in the future...as well as enriching data in JSON after a pull.
